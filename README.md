# OO code using turtle graphics
- From the starting code, polygon_art.py, you are to write an OO program that generates different pieces of art works
- Fork, then, clone this repo
- Read the instructions given in the course's Google Classroom and start coding
- Once you are done, push your final code to your Github repo and modify this README to report on the work you have done

"I finished the OOP polygon_art.py by getting input from the user, creating a draw class, and then drawing the polygon based on the user's choice. There's nothing wrong or any errors, but I want to use inheritance. However, I'm not sure how to maximize its potential, so I will try to implement inheritance and subclasses in my next project."
